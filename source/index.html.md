# Introduction

Welcome to the Tutory API! 

This document describes the Tutory v1 API, which is meant to be used by back-end servers or trusted parties performing administrative tasks. Create a new booking, read user profile and reviews data, and more.

Generally speaking, anything that can be done through the Tutory dashboard (and more) can also be done through this API.

All requests should be send to `tutory.com.au`

## JSON API

The Tutory API requests and responses are using the JSON API format. 

It is a specification for how a client should request that resources be fetched or modified, and how a server should respond to those requests.

JSON API requires use of the JSON API media type `application/vnd.api+json` for exchanging data.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Max",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
    "cuteness": 10
  }
]
```
